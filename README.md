Learning GitHub


This is the first line of text added in the master branch.  It was added after other text was added to the readme-edits branch.  Will it go away with the first merge? Not sure, let's see...

This is a sample readme file created during learning how to use GitHub.  This line was created in the readme-edits branch.

It turns out I get to keep whatever I want during the "Resolve Conflicts" phase.  It also appears I can add more as this line was created during that phase, which concerns me a tad since there are no commit messages associated with adding this line.

The next few lines were created in the master branche.  The very next line (12), will be deleted as part of an edit in the readme-edits branch.  This is being done to follow the tutorial as written instead of how I jumped ahead with the above lines.
--- The original text has been deleted and moved to line 15 ---
Again, Line 12 above shoud be blank after an edit and pull request and merge from readme-edits to master. (not so much, I added descriptive text) 

-- This is the original text from line 12: "Delete this line in readme-edits branch then create a pull request".
