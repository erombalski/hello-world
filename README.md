Learning GitHub


This is the first line of text added in the master branch.  It was added after other text was added to the readme-edits branch.  Will it go away with the first merge? Not sure, let's see...

This is a sample readme file created during learning how to use GitHub.  This line was created in the readme-edits branch.

It turns out I get to keep whatever I want during the "Resolve Conflicts" phase.  It also appears I can add more as this line was created during that phase, which concerns me a tad since there are no commit messages associated with adding this line.
